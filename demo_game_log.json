  "bottom": "The man, once deeply entangled in illegal activities, realized that his life was in constant danger due to the threats from rival groups and law enforcement closing in. To escape this perilous existence, he meticulously devised a plan to fake his own death. Leveraging his extensive knowledge of survival skills, he identified a remote island that could sustain him long-term. With the help of trusted connections, he secured transportation and gathered essential supplies for his new life. After staging a convincing accident, he was declared dead and buried, allowing him to vanish without a trace. Despite the isolation and challenges of starting anew, he found solace in his newfound freedom. From his secluded sanctuary, he sent a letter to his family, revealing his survival and reassuring them of his safety, but ensuring they understood the necessity of maintaining his secret.",
